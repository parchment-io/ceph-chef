# Ceph will use a temporary mount in /var/lib/ceph/tmp to verify install before unmounting and remounting to
# /var/lib/ceph/ceph-XX so as to not have a partial install. This is important to know in the event something
# happens and ceph has not unmounted the tmp mounts. These have to be umount before removing the /var/lib/ceph
# directory.

# 1. umount any mounted OSDs or tmp mounted in /var/lib/ceph/tmp
# 2. Zap all OSD devices including journal if on separate device. This can be done via 'ceph-disk zap <device>' or 'sgdisk --zap-all <device>' if ceph-disk is not installed
# 3. rm -rf /etc/ceph
# 4. rm -rf /var/log/ceph
# 5. rm -rf /var/log/radosgw (if radosgw is on the given node)
# 6. rm -rf /var/run/ceph
# 7. rm -rf /var/lib/ceph
# 8. yum (or apt-get) remove -y ceph && yum (or apt-get) remove -y ceph-radosgw (apt - radosgw) if the node has radosgw installed
# Clean
